# cube

Program that displays a spinning cube projected onto the viewport (either orthographically or with perspective). Made with OpenCV and a matrix algebra class of my creation.

I had to do something like this for a class in high school, but at the time, I didn't have a firm grasp on C++. Now that I'm in college, I'm learning C++ from the ground up, and decided to make a matrix class to help me learn OOP fundamentals in the language (and help with linear algebra homework). Interested in diving into OpenCV, I decided I'd redo this project with my new matrix class and bundle it into this little repository.
